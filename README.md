# Cryptograph-Generator
A simple function that generates a set of integers from a given string. It uses the preliminary matrix multiplication algorithm to generate the code. 

**File name: Cryptography_Gen**

It uses the most basic form of ciphering data; converting the alphabets to the corresponding numbers of their order. Eg. A--> 1
Drawback of this code is that only strings can be encoded. Integers and special characters cannot be encoded.

It converts all the characters into the corresponding ASCII values. The advantage of this method over the previous is that we can convert any input into a cipher 
text.
